# song-finder
This is a project that fetch data from an API and display the data on the UI. it is just simple project to learn fetching a data from api.

it has "get lyrics" button but since i haven't get an api for the lyrics, touching the button "get lyrics"  will return the message saying "No Lyrics Found".
and also due to github restriction i couldn't to play the audio files fetched and rendered on the UI.

api link: https://api.lyrics.ovh/suggest/:searchText

example: https://api.lyrics.ovh/suggest/hello
